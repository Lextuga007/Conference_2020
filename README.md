### For workshop attendees:

There are two ways to access the workshops:

  - Using the RStudio Cloud Workspace **(Our prefered option)**: All
    material is available in the conference workspace:
    <https://bit.ly/3mfJM4k> . This works from your web browser, and you
    do not need R and Rstudio installed on your machine to access it.

  - Using your own machine: You can download zip files of each workshop,
    or if you are familiar with Git and GitHub, you can clone the
    repository. Follow the links in the table above to the relevant
    workshops.

If you are unsure about your setup, or unable to access the material on
your own machine, please use the RStudio Cloud method.

<br>

**To download and use this material on you machine, please use these
steps:**

1.  Make sure you have `R` and RStudio installed.

### For workshop leaders:

If you are using healthcare related datasets as examples, please
consider adding them to the `NHSRdatasets` package. The data can then be
reused by other to learn `R` or when running training. You can find the
package at: <https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets>
